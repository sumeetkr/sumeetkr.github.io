I am an Assistant Professor at Indian School of Business, Hyderabad, with a Ph.D. degree in Societal Computing from the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon. I am interested in reseach problems at the intersection on technology and society. research problems at the intersection of technology and society. My current focus is on finding implicit/hidden advertisements in videos posted on kids platforms like YouTube kids. Advertising to kids is not only illegal in many countries but is also morally wrong considering kids below eight years have not yet developed the cognitive ability to differentiate between content and promotions. Other current projects include analyzing user behavior on online platforms, quantifying polarization on online forums, presence of advertorials disguised as news on news platforms etc. 

Prior joining Amazon, I graduated with a Ph.D. in Societal Computing from the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. My Ph.D. study focused on estimating users' stance on controversial topics using natural language processing and graph mining techniques, advised by [Prof. Kathleen M. Carley](http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/bios/carley/carley.html).
