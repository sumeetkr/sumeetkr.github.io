I am an Assistant Professor at Indian School of Business (ISB), Hyderabad. I am interested in reseach problems at the intersection on technology and society. research problems at the intersection of technology and society. My current focus is on finding implicit/hidden advertisements in videos posted on kids platforms like YouTube kids. Advertising to kids is not only illegal in many countries but is also morally wrong considering kids below eight years have not yet developed the cognitive ability to differentiate between content and promotions. Other current projects include analyzing user behavior on online platforms, quantifying polarization on online forums, presence of advertorials disguised as news on news platforms etc. 

Additionally, I have also conducted research on user experience, investigating the use of phone  sensors in emergencies to improve situational awareness. My teamsâ€™ study on the wireless-emergency-alerting (WEA) service addressed several issues of central importance to emergency alerts' effectiveness and adoption. Some of our recommendations were included in the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) proposed changes to WEA


Prior joining ISB, I graduated with a Ph.D. in Societal Computing from the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. My Ph.D. study focused on estimating users' stance on controversial topics using natural language processing and graph mining techniques, advised by [Prof. Kathleen M. Carley](http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/bios/carley/carley.html).
