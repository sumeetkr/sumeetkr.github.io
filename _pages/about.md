I am an Applied Scientist at Amazon. I am currently working on knowledge extraction to build an authoritative knowledge graph for every product in the world. My research interest lies at the intersection of data mining, nature language processing, and machine learning.

Prior joining Amazon, I graduated with a Ph.D. in Societal Computing from the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. My Ph.D. study focused on understanding people's behaviors in online social networks using natural language processing and graph mining techniques, advised by [Prof. Kathleen M. Carley](http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/bios/carley/carley.html).  One is understanding users' emotion expressions from texts. The other is latent attributes inference of users in social media.
