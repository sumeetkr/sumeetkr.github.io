### Applied Scientist
2020.6 - Present<br />
• Building an automatic knowledge extraction system for every product in the world.


### Applied Scientist Intern
Mentor: Dr. Han Wang, Amazon Alexa AI, 2019.5 - 2019.8<br />
• Built an entity linking system over the entire Amazon music knowledge graph<br />
• Proposed a novel multi-grained matching approach to improve Alexa’s NLU performance with knowledge graph [INTERSPEECH'20].<br />

### Research Assistant
Advisor: Prof. Kathleen M. Carley, CASOS, Carnegie Mellon University, 2015.8 - 2020.5 <br />
• Proposed multiple methods for semantic modeling sentence pairs, with an application on aspect-level sentiment classiﬁcation [EMNLP’19, EMNLP’18, SBP-BRiMS’18].<br />
• Modeling social media users with various types of features, eg. text, categorical features, network, for user attributes prediction [EMNLP’19, TNSE’18, SBP-BRiMS’17, CIKM’17].<br />
• Developed a high throughput tweet collection system. Collected and analyzed more than 40 billion tweets (16TB after compression) from 20 million users using Spark [ASONAM’19, ASONAM’17]<br />

### Research Assistant
Advisor: Prof. Xiaogang Jin, AI Lab, Zhejiang University, 2014-2015 <br />
• Conducted research on analyzing Wikipedia editing pattern.<br />
